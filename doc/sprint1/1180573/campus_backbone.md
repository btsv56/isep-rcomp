## Building Dimensions:

- A : 40 x 20 meters
- B : 60 x 20 meters
- C,D and E : 80 x 30 meters

## Cable Types

     In this project to suport the backbone we have two multimode fiber cables. 
     We picked the multimode fiber because the length is greater than 90  meters (maximum length for copper cables) and lass than 1000 meters (maximum length for multimode fiber cable) and has a fine transmission data rate.

## Cable Pathways

     As main objective we conected all the buildings through the MC in the building A using the cable type described above. We used two cables of fiber for each transmission direction (full duplex) and other two for fail-tolerance (failover).

## Backbone

     To support the failover we opted to implement 8 cables of fiber for each building (making a total of 8 * 4 = 32 cables). For each building we have 4 cables going in the oposite direction of the other 4 cables. This is for failover prevention.
