Network cabling deployment schematics of Building A
===========================================

![Floor 1](piso1.png "Floor One")


## Room dimensions:

- A1.1 : ~ 11.8 x 19.2 m (227 m^2) = out of scope of this project 
- A1.2 : ~ 5.8 x 7.9 m (46 m^2) = min. 10 outlets (Standard)
- A1.3 : ~ 11.8 x 7.4 m (87 m^2) = min. 20 outlets (Standard) (+1 access-point)
- A1.4 : ~ 11.8 x 11.3 m (132 m^2) = min. 28 outlets (Standard)
- A1.5 : 0 outlets
  
### Total of outlets : 58 (+1 Access Points)

## Access-Point Location:

       The access-point is located in the room A1.3 so that can coverage all the improtant area, this includes A1.2, A1.3 and A1.4.


## Cable Types:
        
        Between the HC and the outlets the type of cables used where cobre cables, because the max length didn't go beyond the 90 meters and the end user is most likely to have compatible devices with ethernet cables.
        To connect the MC with the IC's we used fiber cable because it has a considerable distance between them.

## Cross-Connects Locations:

        This building has 1 Main Cross-Connect(MC), 1 Intermediate Cross-Connect (IC), 1 Horizontal Cross-Connect(HC) and 5 Consolidation Points(CP).
        So as it was said this building is commited to house the Datacenter and for that was reserved a wide room in the first floor (A1.1). Taking into account the dimensions of the room I chose to put there the MC, IC and HC.
        The MC, IC and HC are close to floor cable passageway to spend less cable length.
        The CP's are located in each room that have some considerable amount of outlets.
